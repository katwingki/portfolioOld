The first is a simple addition game that rendered with eye-catching pizazz. The second game strengthens logical skills and pattern-matching abilities by sorting a series of draggable circles into boxes by their color. The third game relies on the players\u2019 memory to match pairs of cards with the same animal on them. All three games are progressively harder at each level, we believe the balance of shapes, numbers, colors, and sounds in these games will simulate new connections in the child\u2019s brain.

In this application, I incorporated some fun Minions elements where kids can ask Minions questions and received a response, vice versa, Minions can ask kids questions to see if they are smart enough to be their next master. The testing component is integrated with neural network-based Brain.js library and the training data was normalized with natural npm package.","After accumulating a strong foundation in building PERN Stack with agile methodologies, I decided to challenge myself with some new technologies such as React Native, and Expo for this solo project. One of the big challenges was the natural.js library is not compatible with Expo, I work around it by standardizing the data in React. Overall, I enjoyed the process of trial and error, and I was happy about what I was able to build within the time frame given.
